House Prices problem from https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques

Cleaned and manipulated the data, used a simple linear regression model to predict house prices in Ames, Iowa based on a list of factors.

Added an interaction term and lowered the test RMSLE by 0.1. Still not very accurate, but I'm a first year so...
Currently learning about the Lasso Model, planning to use that.
